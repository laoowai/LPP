# Warehouse distribution problem (LPP)
The repository contains Python scripts implementing Linear Programming methods to solve logistics distribution problems. The scripts utilize the PuLP library, which is a free open-source software written in Python. PuLP is used for modeling linear and integer programs.

# Repository Structure

main.py: This Python script solves a warehouse distribution problem using linear programming. The problem is to minimize the transportation cost from warehouses to customers, given the supply constraints at each warehouse and the demand at each customer.
